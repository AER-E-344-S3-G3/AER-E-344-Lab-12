The presence of ice on wings can change the aerodynamic properties of a wing, so it is important that we understand the effects. By measuring the aerodynamic forces before and after the accretion of ice, we can quantify and predict the effect of icing on performance of aerodynamic bodies. Using force transducers, we are able to collect measurements to quantify aerodynamic forces. Comparing the aerodynamic forces between a clean airfoil and an iced airfoil, we were able to predict how a plane or a wing might respond if an aircraft underwent icing.
