In this lab, we looked at understanding how environmental factors affect aerodynamics and how it is crucial to understand these effects. One significant factor is ice forming on the wings of an aircraft. Ice formation can alter the wing aerodynamics, potentially causing a loss in lift and increased drag. To explore this, we used force and torque transducers in the ISU-UTAS Icing Research Tunnel to analyze aerodynamic forces on an airfoil before the ice was added to the wing and after the ice formed on the wings. The experiment aims to quantify these forces and show the impact of icing on aerodynamic performance. This research enhances our comprehension of aviation challenges caused by icing conditions \citep{lab12-manual}.
